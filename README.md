<h1>Brief explanation of each design pattern I used</h1>
<p>
<h3>1. Strategy Pattern</h3>
The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
The client can dynamically switch between different algorithms or strategies.
</p>
<p>
<h3>2. Observer Pattern</h3>
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
</p>
<p>
<h3>3. Command Pattern</h3>
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undo functionality.
</p>
<p>
<h3>4. State Pattern</h3>
The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class.
</p>
<p>
<h3>5. Chain of Responsibility Pattern</h3>
The Chain of Responsibility pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to handle the request or pass it to the next one.
</p>
<p>
<h3>6. Mediator Pattern</h3>
The Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects by having them interact through a mediator rather than directly.
</p>
<p>
<h3>7. Memento Pattern</h3>
The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>8. Visitor Pattern</h3>
The Visitor pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without modifying them. 
It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
</p>
<p>
<h3>9. Template Method Pattern</h3>
The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
</p>
<p>
<h3>10. Iterator Pattern</h3>
The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
